# steganography

Steganography is a technique that enables us to hide information within images. This program lets you do this by hiding text in images, which you can then use to detect the information hidden inside. 

The complete program is available as a mini web app under **flask**.

Once you've installed the necessary dependencies via
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

You can launch the server by executing the following command:
```
python3 app.py
```

This will launch the mini web app on _port **9970**_.
Open your browser on port [9970](http://127.0.0.1:9970/) to access the web app.

> **Note:** You can change the server configuration by modifying the .env file.
